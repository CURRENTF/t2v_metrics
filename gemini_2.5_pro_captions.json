As it rises, it effectively pulls back from the subject (the person and the immediate ridge).\n3.  **Tilting Up & Expanding View:** While ascending, the camera angle tilts upwards, transitioning from focusing on the ridge texture and the person to revealing the vast expanse of the surrounding mountain range and the sky.\n\nThe overall effect is a dynamic swooping motion, starting intimately with the subject and location, then rapidly expanding to a dramatic, high-angle, wide shot that emphasizes the scale and grandeur of the landscape. This type of movement is characteristic of a drone, likely an FPV (First-Person View) drone, due to its agility and smooth, rapid changes in altitude and direction."

The fortune cookies go out of focus.\n4.  **Pan Right & Rack Focus (0:05 - 0:09):** The camera continues to **pan right** and performs another **rack focus**, bringing the plate of fried rings (calamari/onion rings) into sharp view. The MSG container blurs.\n5.  **Pan Left & Rack Focus (0:09 - 0:13):** Finally, the camera **pans back to the left** and **pulls focus** one last time to the small teal panini press containing a sandwich. The fried rings go out of focus.\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThe camera stays at a **low angle** throughout.

It moves from his left side, circling towards his right and slightly behind him.\n3.  **Elevation/Tilt:** As it arcs, the camera seems to maintain or slightly increase its height relative to the character, possibly tilting upwards slightly to keep his upward-looking face framed.\n4.  **Distance (Subtle):** There might be a very subtle **pull-back (dolly out)** accompanying the arc, making the shot slightly wider by the end, but the primary motion is the orbit around the subject.\n\nIn summary, the dominant camera movement is a **smooth orbit/arc** around the character from left to right/behind, combined with a subtle upward tilt to follow his gaze."

It starts somewhat behind the man, moves around to show more of the woman's back and then their faces in profile, and continues moving around them.\n2.  **Following:** The camera movement directly follows the slow turning motion of the dancers themselves. It keeps them relatively centered or as the main focus within the frame as they rotate.\n3.  **Smoothness:** The movement is generally smooth and fluid, likely achieved with a dolly, Steadicam, or a very controlled handheld shot, contributing to the romantic and slightly dreamlike feel of the scene.\n4.  **Consistent Distance:** The camera appears to maintain a relatively consistent close-to-medium distance from the couple throughout the movement.\n\nIn summary, the camera performs a smooth, **arcing pan** that **follows** the slow dance rotation of the couple, keeping them close in the frame and enhancing the intimacy of the moment."

The movement is timed to follow the action of the stamp peeling off.\n\nIn short: The camera starts close and executes a smooth **pull back** and **upward movement** as the game stamp is peeled."

    "gemini-2.5-pro-preview": "Okay, here's a description of the camera movement in the video clip:\n\n1.  **Wide Aerial Establishing Shot & Rapid Approach:** The video starts with a relatively wide, high-angle aerial shot, establishing the desert landscape with dunes, a small shelter, a person, a camel, and a car driving in the distance. Almost immediately, the camera performs a very rapid dolly or zoom forward and downwards, rushing towards the action near the shelter and the approaching car.\n2.  **Low-Angle High-Speed Tracking:** The camera then transitions to a low-angle, high-speed tracking shot. It moves dynamically alongside or slightly behind the blue car as it drifts and kicks up sand on the dunes. This creates a sense of speed and immersion in the car's movement.\n3.  **Immersive Sand Impact:** The final movement is characterized by the camera seemingly being engulfed or impacted by the massive spray of sand and debris kicked up by the car. The perspective becomes very close, chaotic, and filled with the texture of the flying sand, giving a visceral, almost first-person experience of the sand blast."

    "gemini-2.5-pro-preview": "Based on the video clip:\n\n1.  **Following/Tracking:** The camera follows the skateboarder's movement. It stays relatively close to the subject as they push off and start rolling forward.\n2.  **Low Angle:** The camera is positioned very low to the ground, providing a dynamic, close-up view of the skateboard and the skater's feet.\n3.  **Forward Movement:** The camera moves forward along the sidewalk, matching the direction and approximate speed of the skateboarder.\n4.  **Slight Shake/Instability:** There's a slight natural shake, suggesting it might be handheld or mounted in a way that captures the vibrations and motion of the action (like mounted on the board itself or held closely by someone moving alongside).\n5.  **Wide-Angle/Fisheye:** The lens used is wide-angle, possibly fisheye, as evidenced by the distortion and curvature, especially visible at the edges of the frame. While not strictly camera *movement*, the lens choice significantly affects the perceived motion and field of view.\n\nIn summary, it's a **low-angle tracking shot moving forward** with the subject, likely using a wide-angle/fisheye lens, and exhibiting slight instability characteristic of action filming."

This reveals more of the man previously partially visible on the left and introduces a fourth person (wearing glasses) even further to the left.\n\nIn summary, the camera movement is a **slow zoom out** or **pull back**, expanding the view from a focus on two main figures to encompass a wider group of four individuals."
